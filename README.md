# Kramiek's Purrrfect Memepicker

## Overview

**Live version [here](https://purrfect-memepicker.netlify.app/)**

I'm currently refreshing my entire JavaScript knowledge through a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses)
The assignment focused primarily on different essential JavaScript concepts such as:
* **for of** loops
* **import/export:** using JavaScript modules; really interesting as I also had to deploy my server, before I discovered I could just do this way more easily from VSCode itself xD
* **Radio/Checkbox Input** and rendering these based on input data via Javascript
* **querySelector**, had used this before so nothing much new
* **getElementsByClassName**, again not too new as I had used this tonnes of times before in previous assignments
* **classList** and all it's possibilities
* **.includes()**
* **.filter()**, really powerful this one! and a joy to use

With these basics, the app basically reads an array of different objects in a JS Module, draws elements on the screen and allows you to pick a 'mood'.
The selected 'mood' returns a matching GIF or meme of Cats.

## Some background

I made this app my own and called it 'Kramiek's Purrrfect Memepicker', after our recently deceased cat Kramiek ðŸ˜¿
